Exercise 2
----------

- Create a file called expectations.txt, write a paragraph on what you hope to get out of bootcamp.
- Move the lost file to the found directory, and commit only this change.
- Modify the authors.txt file with your name, save it and stage the file.
- Run the git status command.
- Modify the authors file to add your github account ID after to your name. Look at the status command. What did you notice? Put the answer in the expectations.txt file.
- Add all the files to staging, and commit all the files. Is your working directory clean?
